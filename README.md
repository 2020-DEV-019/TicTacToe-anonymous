# TicTacToe-anonymous

This is a TicTacToe game requested by BNP for a technical test. 

You can play the game by running the project through XCode 11, I used the 11.3.1 build. 

To run the project, open the TicTacToe.xcproject. Then press the Run button on the top left of XCode, launching the game on a iOS Simulator or a real device.

This TicTacToe game is built using a binary representation of the game board and player moves. I think its memory and computing efficient even if a lot of factoring and/or optimization is possible. 

Hope you will like it.

Thanks.
